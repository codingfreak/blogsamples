# Bicep Part 5

## Disclaimer

**Don't take this series as an advice to use the presented tools in your environment! You could because everything is released on public sources (it is not open sourced yet). However all of this is highly opinionated!**

## Summary

In this part I want to start over where we left Bicep in 2022. Bicep has evolved and a lot of stuff is better now. On the other hand it is still at 0.31 and a lot of the problem still exist.

In this part I want to prepare my viewers to more stuff upcoming. Doing so requires me to show you guys what I use in my daily work in order to make my life easier with IaC.

So essentially I want to introduce you to the Bicep library my company DEVDEER has released over the past years and also showcase the tooling on PowerShell side.

This video shows all of this in action without drilling into the details. So you will see how we and our customers are interacting with Azure. Later parts will cover the details.

Buckle up!
